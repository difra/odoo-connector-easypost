==================
EasyPost Connector
==================

This module provides EasyPost connector functionality.


Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

* Install Python dependencies -
  ``pip install easypost``
* Install OCA Connector module from https://github.com/OCA/connector
* Install ``stock_delivery_label_new`` from https://github.com/laslabs/odoo-stock.git
* Install Easypost Connector module
* Restart Odoo (requirement of any new connector to set proper DB triggers)

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to ``Connectors => [EasyPost] Backends``
* Configure one EasyPost backend per company you would like to use with

Usage
=====

Address Verification
--------------------

* Edit a partner in backend form view
* Click ``Validate`` button above street address
* Click ``Confirm`` button to validate address is correct, or ``Cancel`` to cancel

Note that the address change will be made immediately after hitting ``Confirm``,
regardless of whether you save the partner or not.


Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* Handle validation errors from addresses
* Some duplicate calls to EasyPost (Address, Shipment) - seems to be just in the tests though
* Add a default EasyPost connection to span all companies
* Mass address verification
* Label import operates in Shipment context, due to needing selected rate info not within PostageLabel
* Shipment buy workflow is a little ghetto with the intermediary wizard
